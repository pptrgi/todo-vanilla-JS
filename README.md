# ToDo App

The ToDo App was developed using JavaScript and styled with vanilla CSS. It's a simple and user-friendly app that allows users to add new tasks, categorize them as either business or personal, edit and delete tasks, and mark them as completed with a checkbox.

The tasks are saved and retrieved from the device's local storage on page load or as you add them - they won't disappear on page refresh. To update a task, the task's body is displayed on a disabled text field which is re-enabled to accept input when the edit button is clicked.

The application's clean, intuitive and straightforward design makes it easy for users to navigate and manage their tasks effectively.

The app's main features include:

1. Categorize tasks as business or personal tasks
1. Check the completed tasks
1. Edit and update your already added tasks
1. Delete button to remove the completed or unwanted tasks
1. Add new tasks
1. Display for all existing tasks
